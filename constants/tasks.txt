Godot side:
Create AudioManager to play sounds. Can be child of scripts in game_tree and have singleton instance access pattern (class_name AudioManager + static var instance: AudioManager & ready(): instance = self) making use of it like this: AudioManager.instance.play_sound_foo().
Add audio assets.
Add graphical assets. They can be child of CanvasLayer in game_tree. Accompanying script is probably good to make as well to control visibilities and tween single assets.
Add all texts and choices to dialogue script from story
Style the dialogue with RichTextLabel BBCode styling. (see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/4.2-31d1c0c/gui/rich_text_bbcode/screenshots/rich_text_bbcode.webp)
Add finished typewriting sounds to DialogueUiManager (look for comment # todo audio manager should/could play a randomized typewriter sound). Playing text sounds follow audio pattern for example “0101” where every other character plays a sound (var play_sound_pattern exists and is “1010” by default).
Limit typewriting sounds to certain situations: maybe just the email, or change sound afterwards to different one 
Add support for continuing text on screen instead of clearing the text and starting writing new one. Not top priority.
When near playable build tomorrow change text skip style to speed up instead of skip instantly (now at skip to make testing fast).
Add (inbe)tweens to values in game to make it juicy.
Make game builds (maybe feedback build + final build)
Add some font that is used.
Make sure text is not scrollable and no scroll bars appear.
Add option to go back to main menu and restart game. Low priority.

Game Design
Decide when to use quantum scramble text effect (see also if it works with bbcode tags)
Maybe in the memories that are unlocked through the quantum echoes?
Decide whether to use fade to blacks or not and where
Design how the echo based visual effects and basic visual effects work and put it to GDD, to be implemented by programmers.
